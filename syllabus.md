# Assessment

1.  ****Attend weekly lab sessions and complete the assigned readings and exercises (40%)****
    -   Wednesday class sessions will usually be programming labs. We will be using Jupyter notebooks to learn Python, which are part of a web-based interactive programming environment. You must have a github account to access the server. If you do not have an account go to <https://github.com/join> and set one up. Assignments will be completed in this environment and submitted to the instructor. Details of using this system for assignments will be covered in the first lab session.
    -   Assignments will usually be due at <span class="underline"><span class="underline">11.59 p.m. (EST) on the Friday</span></span> (but this may vary). These assignments are intended to help students practice the programming concepts and structures introduced in lab and build confidence. They should not be difficult or take excessive time but they do build from week to week so it is <span class="underline">very</span> important to keep up.

1.  ****Complete a <span class="underline">data story project</span> that uses the techniques and theory covered in class to carry out a data analysis of a specific research question agreed upon with the instructor (60%)****
    -   More details of the kinds of projects that would be appropriate and manageable will be discussed during the first few weeks of class.
    
    -   The key steps of the project will be scheduled throughout the course allowing for the instructor to help you find a manageable problem, acquire the necessary data and be able to carry out the appropriate computational analysis.
    
    -   We will discuss the expected structure and components of the project. Some elements will be assessed on an individual basis (e.g. in your group you will each be responsible for one of the data sources relevant to your research question and you will carry out the acquisition, inspection, cleaning and exploration steps on that data source) and others will be graded as a group (e.g. the initial and final project presentations and the project blog)

# Note about learning programming

-   One of the aims of this class is to help students begin to develop
    data analysis and programming skills that they can use as a part of
    carrying out research. But like learning any new skill, such as a
    new spoken language, it takes time and can be frustrating at
    first. This course does not require students to have any programming
    background. Realistically it is not possible to become a fully
    proficient programmer in just one semester. However, the lab
    sessions and assignments are focused on helping you begin this
    process and to become comfortable with reading, understanding and
    modifying Python and R code examples that you can find on the web
    etc.

-   **Using generative AI tools** - We will talk more about the potential
    benefits and drawbacks of using generative AI tools such as ChatGPT
    and Copilot to learn programming as the course progresses. There is
    neither a blanket prohibition or full encouragement for the use of
    these developing tools in this course. I will provide more guidance
    as we go along.

# Schedule


## **NOTE** This is a tentative schedule is will be updated as the course progresses


## Class structure

-   Usually each class session will be divided into two parts:

-   **Content and Discussion** - This part of the class will introduce
    and review the key topics onlined in the schedule. It is important
    that you read the assigned material BEFORE the class as you'll be
    expected to engage in discussion and other activities based on this
    content.
-   **Lab activities** - The second part will be focused on pratical
    exercises to put into practice what we have been learning about
    thinking about, collecting, analyzing, interpreting and
    communicating data.
